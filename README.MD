# Get Started
> Migrating from the old dotfiles? run the following command to clean things up before you install: `rm -rf ~/.znap ~/.asdf ~/.dotfiles`
> Make sure to backup your `~/.ssh/config` file as we're now managing that as part of this repo.

## Github Access Token
In order to avoid any issues with rate limiting on the GH API, I recommend adding a [personal access token](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server@3.4/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token) to your shell env. You can do this by setting one of these env variables:
- `CHEZMOI_GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN`
- `GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN`
- `GITHUB_TOKEN`


## Install chezmoi on your machine using the shell script.
> We're installing it to the `~/.local/bin` directory to accomodate as many Unix-style OSs as possible.

I recommend forking the repo into your own `dotfiles` repo and then using the below command to install chezmoi, clone the repo and apply it in one step.
> Note: this one-liner assumes it is cloning a repo called `dotfiles` from the user `$GITHUB_USERNAME`, make sure that's what you call your fork.
> Otherwise, please check the `chezmoi` docs for how to specify a different repo name.
```shell
sh -c "$(curl -fsLS get.chezmoi.io)" -- -b $HOME/.local/bin init --apply $GITHUB_USERNAME
```
